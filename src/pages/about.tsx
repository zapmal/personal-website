      <p>
        Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Manuel Zapata, Software Engineer based in Zulia,
        Venezuela.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like solving exciting and â€”sometimesâ€” complex problems. I enjoy
        learning, be it new or old principles and technologies that I can apply
        in building new, usable, and robust software. Most of my work is publicly available
        on GitHub, which I've been using since ~2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently in my final year of Computer Science and working as a Full Stack dev.
        Outside of programming, I enjoy video games, chess, cooking and{' '}
        <em>sometimes </em>languages.
      </p>
    </Layout>
